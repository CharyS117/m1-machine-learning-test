# m1-machine-learning-test

Work in progress.

This repo contains some sample code to benchmark the new M1 MacBooks (M1 Pro and M1 Max) against various other pieces of hardware.

## TODO
* Add larger test (e.g. Food101 dataset and bigger network)
* Update reproduce tests
* Create document to detail how to install `tensorflow-macos` on various M1 notebooks
* Add results of different chips: M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, Colab (K80), Intel top spec MacBook Pro

## Steps (how to test your machine)
1. Clone this repo
2. Create an environment
3. Install dependencies (TensorFlow/various other data science libraries)
4. Run various notebooks (results come at the end of the notebooks)
